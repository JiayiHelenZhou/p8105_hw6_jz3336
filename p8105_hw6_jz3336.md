## Probelm 1:

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ 0,
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ 0,
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ 1,
    )
  ) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL",
         victim_race %in% c("White", "Black")) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolution, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex)
```

Start with one city:

``` r
baltimore_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD")

glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex,
    data = baltimore_df,
    family = binomial()) %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(term, OR, starts_with("CI")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digit = 3)
```

| term              |    OR | CI\_lower | CI\_upper |
| :---------------- | ----: | --------: | --------: |
| (Intercept)       | 1.363 |     0.975 |     1.907 |
| victim\_age       | 0.993 |     0.987 |     1.000 |
| victim\_raceWhite | 2.320 |     1.648 |     3.268 |
| victim\_sexMale   | 0.426 |     0.325 |     0.558 |

Try this across cities:

``` r
model_results_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  nest(data = -city_state) %>% 
  mutate(
    models = map(.x = data, ~glm(resolution ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    results = map(models, broom::tidy)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, results) %>% 
  unnest(results) %>% 
  mutate(
    OR = exp(estimate),
    CI_lower = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
    CI_upper = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, term, OR, starts_with("CI"))
```

Plot:

``` r
model_results_df %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_raceWhite") %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, OR)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = OR)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = CI_lower, ymax = CI_upper)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

*Comment:* This is plot of odd ratios which compared white homicide
victims to black homicide victims. The odd ratios in the majority of the
city sates are larger than 1. Therefore, relative to black homicide
victim, homicides in which the victims are white are much more likely to
be resolved.
